# Problem 1: Using inline R and plotting with ggplot

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

The variables in this dataset refer to the time and place of data collection (origin, year, month, day, hour, day_hour), and measures of weather (temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib).

There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` observations and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` variables in the dataset. 

The mean temperature is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp), digits=2) ` degrees Fahrenheit.
