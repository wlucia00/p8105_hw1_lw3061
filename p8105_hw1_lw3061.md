# Problem 1: Using inline R and plotting with ggplot

The following code was used to output the dataset:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The variables in this dataset refer to the time and place of data
collection (origin, year, month, day, hour, day_hour) for various
measures of weather (temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib).

There are *358 observations* and *15 variables* in the dataset.

The mean temperature is *39.58 degrees Fahrenheit*.

This is a scatterplot of the variables *time_hour* and *temp*.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

Some patterns in this plot:

- the temperature increased gradually as the month went on
- each day there is a rise and fall in temperature corresponding to day
  or night
- the range of temperatures is around 25-60 degrees Fahrenheit

# Problem 2: Understand variable types

A new dataframe is created below:

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  samp_n = rnorm(n=10),
  log_n = samp_n > 0,
  char_n = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "that", "is", "of", "length", "ten"),
  factor_n = factor(c(1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2))
)
```

Trying to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe looks like
this:

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, samp_n))
```

    ## [1] 0.0226754

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, log_n))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, char_n))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, char_n)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, factor_n))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, factor_n)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean is calculable for the numeric vector of the random sample and
the logical vector indicating if those numbers are greater than 0.
