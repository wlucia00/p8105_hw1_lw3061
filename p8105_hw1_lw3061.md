``` r
data("early_january_weather")

The variables in this dataset refer to the time and place of data
collection (origin, year, month, day, hour, day_hour), and measures of
weather (temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib).

There are 358 observations and 15 variables in the dataset.

The mean temperature is 39.58 degrees Fahrenheit.
